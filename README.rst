Docker0s uses docker-compose to manage multiple containerised apps on a single host.

Bring together standard docker-compose files across multiple projects in a single simple
manifest file, written in either YAML or Python with pre- and post-operation hooks, to
deploy to a single host.

It's designed for small self-hosted low-maintenance deployments which don't need the
complexity of Kubernetes - think k8s with zero features and a much simpler config
syntax, with simple app manifests instead of helm charts.

There is a collection of ready-to-use app manifests at `docker0s-manifests`_, with
examples for how to deploy them to your host.

Quickstart
==========

Install::

    pip install docker0s


Put together a manifest in YAML as ``d0s-manifest.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    apps:
      traefik:
        path: git+https://github.com/radiac/docker0s-manifests.git@main#traefik
        env_file: traefik.env
      storage:
        path: ../apps/storage
      website:
        type: MountedApp
        path: "git+ssh://git@github.com:radiac/example.com.git@main"
        env:
          DOMAIN: example.radiac.net
    host:
      name: example.radiac.net


or in Python as ``d0s-manifest.py``, using subclassing to perform actions before and
after operations and add custom functionality:

.. code-block:: python

    from docker0s import MountedApp

    class Website(MountedApp):
        # Clone a repo to the host and look for docker-compose.yml in there
        path = "git+ssh://git@github.com:radiac/example.com.git@main"
        env = {
            "DOMAIN": "example.radiac.net"
        }

        # Subclass operation methods to add your own logic
        def deploy(self):
            # Perform action before deployment, eg clean up any previous deployment
            super().deploy()
            # Perform action after deployment, eg push additional resources

    class Vagrant(Host):
        name = "vagrant"

Then run a command, eg::

    docker0s deploy
    docker0s up
    docker0s restart website.django
    docker0s exec website.django /bin/bash
    docker0s cmd website app_command arguments
